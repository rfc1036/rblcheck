This program is a very basic interface to DNS listings such as the DNSBL
filter operated by the MAPS project. The basic idea of the filter is that
when someone is listed (for example, a blacklist for email abusers), a new
domain name is resolved of the form "2.0.0.127.domain.name.com", where
2.0.0.127 is the abusive IP address in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127
would be the IP address 127.0.0.2), and "domain.name.com" is the base
domain name of the filtering service (such as "blackholes.mail-abuse.org",
for the MAPS project DNSBL filter).

To learn how to build this program, please read docs/INSTALL. Seriously.
Make sure to check the default lists of DNSBLs in the "sites.h" file.
