Changes since 1.4:

- Converted to automake/autoconf for configuration, which should make
  it easier to extend portability.

- Added support for checking multiple addresses in one invokation.

- Added support for reading addresses to check from standard input, by
  specifying an argument of '-'.

- Updated sites.h to mesh with current reality (almost ALL of the sites
  listed had changed since the last update). Added a recommendation that
  distribution maintainers NOT enable any of the listings by default.

- Converted documentation to docbook, with a script for automatically
  generating html, ps, and rtf formats.

- Added an RPM spec file.
