<Chapter id="about">
<Title>About rblcheck</Title>
<Para>
rblcheck is a very basic interface to
<ULink url="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/">RBL</ULink>-style
DNS listings such as those operated by the
<ULink url="http://mail-abuse.org/">MAPS</ULink> and
<ULink url="http://www.orbs.org/">ORBS</ULink> projects.
</Para>

<Para>
The general idea behind RBL-style listings is rapid lookup of IP
addresses using DNS (for example, for blacklisting IP addresses because
of abuse). Each IP address is reversed and has a domain name attached to
it; for example, the IP address 127.0.0.2 would become 2.0.0.127, and then
a domain such as "relays.visi.com" would be added to it. You
would then try to resolve the result (ie. 2.0.0.127.relays.visi.com);
if you receive a positive reply, then you know that the address is listed.
Further information can also be queried, such as text descriptions of why
the address was listed.

<Section id="building_compiling">
<Title>Compiling</Title>

<Para>
Before building rblcheck, edit the file <Filename>sites.h</Filename> for
the listings you wish to check against (to un-comment a listing, remove
the <ComputerOutput>/*</ComputerOutput> and <ComputerOutput>*/</ComputerOutput>
around the <ComputerOutput>SITE(...)</ComputerOutput> line).
</Para>

<Para>
To compile rblcheck, just run <Application>./configure</Application> in
the main directory, followed by <Application>make</Application> when the
first command is complete.
</Para>

<Para>
To make sure that what you now have works correctly, run <Application>make
check</Application>; make sure that you have an Internet connection handy when
you do, or a large number of the tests will produce (non-fatal) failures.
</Para>

<Para>
When you are done, you can type <Application>make install</Application> to
install the software (by default, everything will be installed in
<Filename class="directory">/usr/local</Filename>.
</Para>

<Para>
For more details on how the <Application>configure</Application> command
works, please see the file <Filename>INSTALL</Filename> in the main directory,
which has a complete breakdown of all of your options.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="building_developers">
<Title>Note to developers</Title>
<Para>
You may have received the version of rblcheck that you're currently working
from via a nightly CVS snapshot (the file you downloaded would likely have
been called <Application>rblcheck-20020101.tar.gz</Application> or something
similar), or you might have downloaded a version of the source directly from
the <ULink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=2081">CVS</ULink>
tree. The most distinguishing feature of these developer-only versions is
the lack of a <Application>configure</Application> script in the main
distribution directory, and the presense of a
<Application>bootstrap</Application> script instead. These releases are not
for the faint of heart, and you may very well be unable to build them
without a bit of work. As a matter of fact, the documentation you're reading
right now may not even apply to one of these experimental versions.
</Para>
<Para>
If you are not building a development release, you do NOT need to read this
section, as none of these instructions apply to you. Please read
<XRef linkend="building_compiling"> for instructions on how to build a
normal rblcheck release.
</Para>
<Para>
And with that out of the way, welcome to rblcheck development! You will need
a number of utilities to build a development release, above and beyond the
usual build requirements:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem><Para>
<ULink url="http://sources.redhat.com/autoconf/">Autoconf</ULink> 2.13
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
<ULink url="http://sources.redhat.com/automake/">Automake</ULink> 1.4
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
<ULink url="http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/">docbook-tools</ULink>
0.6.8 (the Red Hat RPM package identifies itself as docbook-utils, other
distributions may name the package differently, if they include it at all)
</Para></ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>
Autoconf and automake are tools which make cross-platform development easier
by automatically checking for issues related to particular platforms. The
basic idea is to ensure that even though the primary developers of a piece
of software may not have access to a wide range of platforms, the chances of
a successful "out of the box" build will still work. The reality is a little
different, of course, but it works relatively well. If this sounds like your
cup of tea, you might be interested in reading the definitive book on GNU
Autotools: <ULink url="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/">GNU Autoconf,
Automake, and Libtool</ULink>.
</Para>
<Para>
The docbook-tools package is required for building multiple formats of the
documentation included with rblcheck. The documentation is written entirely
in SGML (Docbook 4.1), and is located in the file
<Filename>docs/rblcheck.sgml</Filename>.
</Para>
<Para>
Once you've verified that you have these installed, you'll need to run
<Application>./bootstrap</Application> from the main rblcheck source
directory, which will create a number of the files you need to complete
the build. At this point, you should follow the usual instructions for
building the application (see <XRef linkend="building_compiling">).
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="building_distributors">
<Title>Note to distributors and packagers</Title>

<Para>
If you're distributing a pre-built version of rblcheck for your users, I
strongly recommend leaving everything in <Filename>sites.h</Filename>
commented out. The ability to add sites there was only added as a convenience
feature for people building a personal copy for their own use, and was never
intended to be used to pre-set policy for people using pre-packaged versions.
</Para>
<Para>
Over the years, there has been a great deal of volatility in the RBL listing
"market"; even the venerable MAPS RBL is no longer publically available
without making special arrangements. Therefore, along with those pre-defined
lists of RBL services is built-in obsolescence.
</Para>
<Para>
As a side-note, I don't make new releases just to update the
<Filename>sites.h</Filename> file, and at some point in the future, I'll
probably stop seeding it with suggestions. As the package maintainer, you're
taking on the burden of keeping that up-to-date. Do you really want that
hassle, or would it just be easier to point your users at a list of RBL
services that is up-to-date (see the
<ULink url="http://rblcheck.sourceforge.net/">rblcheck homepage</ULink>
for links to several current listings)?
</Para>
<Para>
You're also making life a more difficult for the user; users will come to
depend on that pre-built list of sites. What happens when, by necessity, you
need to change that built-in list (because some listings are no longer
available, or because new ones are now online)? Your users will very likely
complain about the change in behavior, and rightly so. Even worse, what does
the user do when they disagree with your selection of services? Recompile
from source (which defeats the purpose of providing them with a pre-compiled
binary in the first place)? Let them pick their own listings. You and your
users will be much happier.
</Para>
<Para>
If you feel that you just can't release rblcheck without a built-in list,
may I suggest using the global <Filename>rblcheckrc</Filename> which the
<Application>rbl</Application> script uses? At least that way, the end
user can change your pre-selections on their own, without having to build
from source.

You can check multiple addresses at once, to make life a little easier
with scripts; just add additional addresses on the command line after all

address).

please see below about reporting bugs and finding help.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="using_rbl">
<Title>The rbl wrapper</Title>

<Para>
A recent addition to the rblcheck package is the <Application>rbl</Application>
shell script, which is a simple wrapper around rblcheck, with one special
feature: it will read a global <Filename>rblcheckrc</Filename> (usually
in <Filename class="directory">/etc</Filename> or
<Filename class="directory">/usr/etc</Filename>), and then
a <Filename>.rblcheckrc</Filename> from the current user's home directory.
These files can contain any of the usual <Application>rblcheck</Application>
command-line arguments (see <XRef linkend="using_rblcheck">), but are most
useful for setting the most common RBL-style listings you use day-to-day.
</Para>

<Para>
For example, your personal <Filename>.rblcheckrc</Filename> might contain:
</Para>

<Screen>-t
-m
-c
-s relays.ordb.org
-s relays.visi.com
-s some.future.rbl.listing</Screen>

<Para>
Please note that for mail filtering, or any performance-sensitive use, you
should use <Application>rblcheck</Application> directly, to avoid adding
additional latency to the process. <Application>rbl</Application> is
mainly intended as a convenience tool for interactive use.
</Para>
</Section>
</Chapter>

<Chapter id="thirdparty">
<Title>Third-Party Software</Title>
<Para>
rblcheck works well as a command-line tool for performing lookups, but it
also serves an important role working with other software, such as mail
servers and email filtering programs.
</Para>

<Section id="thirdparty_procmail">
<Title>Procmail</Title>

<Para>
rblcheck was really designed to be used with procmail, as long as you have
access to the IP address of the system sending you email. Surprisingly,
most MTAs make obtaining this information more difficult than it needs to
be. The procmail rule I present here assumes you've found some way to put
the IP address of the sender in the variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>.
See the sections below on Sendmail and QMail for ideas on how you can get
ahold of this value.
</Para>

<Para>
The following procmail rule will, once you have <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>,
use rblcheck to look up the IP address in the built-in filters:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>:0
* ! ? if [ -n "$TCPREMOTEIP" ]; then rblcheck -q "$TCPREMOTEIP"; fi
{
	EXITCODE=100
	LOGABSTRACT=all
	LOG="Filter: RBL-filtered address: \"$TCPREMOTEIP\"
"
	:0:
	$FILTER_FOLDER
}</ProgramListing>

<Para>
<EnVar>FILTERFOLDER</EnVar> is assumed to have been set up ahead of
time as the place to put email that you don't want to see (either another
incoming folder, /dev/null, or a 'formail' invokation that rewrites the
message and tacks on an extra header or munges the subject so you can
easily identify it.
</Para>

<Para>
Note that <EnVar>EXITCODE</EnVar> above is for QMail, and indicates a
permanent error. Under Sendmail, 77 is more appropriate. Under anything
else, it's hard to say; your best bet is to refer to the documentation
regarding execution of programs.
</para>

<Para>
One more thing: procmail has a nasty habit of munging the environment, but
most MTAs already do this for you. Hence, you should add the '-p' flag to
the invokation of procmail (either from a local delivery rule in Sendmail,
or from a .forward or .qmail file). This will ensure that procmail doesn't
clean out the value of <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>.
</Para>

<Para>
To test the procmail recipe:
</Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Save any mail message, with full headers, to a file.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Run procmail with the environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar> set
to an offending address, and with the message you just saved as input:
<Screen>cat message | env - TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.2 procmail -p</Screen>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Check your procmail log and mailbox. If the message went through,
you have a problem. If you have a message in your logfile stating
that the message was bounced for being in the RBL, you're fine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Run procmail with the environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar> set
to a non-filtered address, such as 127.0.0.1, and with the message as input:
<Screen>cat message | env - TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.1 procmail -p</Screen>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Check your procmail log and mailbox. If the message didn't go
through, you have a problem. If you have a copy of the message in
your mailbox, and no errors in your log file, you're fine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</OrderedList>
</Section>

<Section id="thirdparty_sendmail">
<Title>Sendmail</Title>

<Para>
This solution for obtaining the IP address of the connecting host could be
considered to be a bit of a hack, but it works quite reliably. If you're
an ordinary user on your system, you won't be able to use this; talk to
your system administrator about the possibility of installing the
sendmail.cf patch below. Point them at this file as a source of
information.
</Para>

<Para>
Currently, in your sendmail.cf file, you'll probably have something like:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@SnE, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=mail -f $g -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
Or, if you're using procmail as the local delivery agent:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@ShPfn, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=procmail -a $h -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
This is the local delivery rule used to execute .forward scripts.  Your
system might use something like <Application>rsh</Application> or another
restricted shell instead of <Application>sh</Application> for running
programs. Don't let that scare you; they all basically work the same.
</Para>

<Para>
Change the above lines to look like this (there will also be Mprog lines
which look similar; you can modify them in exactly the same manner):
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/usr/bin/env, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@SnE, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=env TCPREMOTEIP="${client_addr}" mail -f $g -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
(replacing "mail -f $g -d $u" with "procmail -a $h -d $u" appropriately.)
</Para>

<Para>
ONLY change the P=... and A=... entries. Most certainly do not mess with
F=... unless you know what you are doing.
</Para>

<Para>
This will create an environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>, which
you can now use with rblcheck to determine if the address has been blocked.
To test this, set up an alias like:
</Para>

<Screen>foo: |mailx -s "$TCPREMOTEIP" user@domain.com</Screen>

<Para>
Then, send email to the alias "foo" (or whatever). You should
immediately get a piece of email with the IP address which sent the
message in the subject line. (Replace <Application>mailx</Application>
with <Application>mail</Application> on some systems.)
</Para>

<Para>
This is about the most efficient means of getting this information to
executed programs that I can see with sendmail. What would -really- be
nice here would be a way to program how Sendmail sets up the environment
before executing an external program, at the point of execution. Bug the
Sendmail developers if you agree with me. ;-)
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="thirdparty_qmail">
<Title>QMail</Title>

<Para>
Getting this going under QMail turns out to be a real challenge, since
QMail doesn't have the same level of programmability that Sendmail has.
Hence, we need to employ an additional script to grab the IP address from
the headers. (Thanks to Russell Nelson for confirming QMail's behavior
here.)
</Para>

<Para>
QMail has a very specific means of adding Received: lines to messages,
making them relatively easy to parse. For example, the following headers
are typical:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Return-Path: &lt;emarshal@xnet.com&gt;
Delivered-To: emarshal@LOGIC.NET
Received: (qmail 26029 invoked from network); 13 Oct 1997 15:04:13 -0000
Received: from quake.xnet.com (HELO mail.xnet.com) (198.147.221.35)
  by labyrinth.logic.net with SMTP; 13 Oct 1997 15:04:13 -0000
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
We can disregard the Return-Path: and Delivered-To: lines; they're
unimportant to us. The Received: headers are the most interesting. The
first Received: line we'll see is the local delivery of the mail; hence,
the "qmail 2609 invoked from network". The second Received: line is the
most important to us; it's the one which contains the IP address of the
sender...in this case, 198.147.221.35. To complicate things, the "(HELO
mail.xnet.com)" section may not exist, and the IP address might have ident
information prepended to it (like "qmailr@198.147.221.35").
</Para>

<Para>
Two programs are provided to help you retrieve this information
automatically from the headers, both with the same semantics. "origip.c"
compiles into "origip", and for those who have trouble compiling it (if
you do, please email me with any errors), "origip.awk" is provided which
behaves the same way.
</Para>

<Para>
Essentially, you pass either of these programs an email message, and they
in turn extract the sending address and either print it back to you, or
exit with a non-zero return value.
</Para>

<Para>
To use this in procmail, just use:
</Para>

<Screen>TCPREMOTEIP=`origip || echo 127.0.0.1`</Screen>

<Para>
This will pipe the message through origip (replace origip with
"origip.awk" in the case of using the awk script), and will capture the
address. If there is an error, we'll default to 127.0.0.1, which will
allow the mail through.
</Para>

<Para>
(If you're undecided which program of the two you want to use, consider
that the C version is much faster, and will be maintained more than the
awk script. However, the C version is probably more prone to bugs. ;-)
</Para>

<Para>
Once you have that line in place, go ahead and use the procmail recipe
supplied above in good health.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="thirdparty_inetd_smtpd">
<Title>inetd and smtpd</Title>

<Para>
If you use an smtp server which runs from inetd (sendmail can operate this
way, as can QMail and a number of other MTAs), here's a good way to do
site-wide filtering using rblcheck; add the following to /etc/hosts.allow:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
smtpd: ALL: spawn /usr/local/bin/rblcheck -q %a &amp;&amp; \
	exec /usr/local/bin/smtpd || /bin/echo \
	"469 Connection refused. See http://maps.vix.com/rbl/\r\b\r\n"
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
This gives you RBL support on a site-wide basis, even if native support
doesn't yet exist for your MTA of choice. This assumes that your inetd has
support for tcp_wrappers checks; many Linux variants fall into this
category, but other platforms may differ.
</Para>

<Para>
A word of warning, however: there are a number of very good reasons to not
run a production mail server from inetd, which I won't elaborate on here.  
You might want to investigate more secure and reliable alternatives, such
as tcpserver from D. J. Bernstein's excellent
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</ULink> package.
</Para>

<Title>Other Software</Title>

<Para>
Don't ask me. If you figure out a way to make this work under another
setup, let me know how you did it, and I'll add it here. If you find
better ways of doing this than the ones I'm using above, let me know too,
and you'll see your idea show up in here in the next release.

will earn you fame, fortune, and a warm fuzzy feeling for having
made the world a better place. ;-)

Follow CNAMEs from rblcheck(). This will let us get at the eventual
TXT RRs for a domain name.

Optional support for
<ULink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/adns/adns.html">adns</ULink>.

Timeout option. Should default to no timeout, but apparently there is
an issue with rblcheck hanging in an offline environment where the
nameserver in use is located off-site. This would compensate for the
misconfiguration, and provide a 'quick-fail' mode for people to play
with. I'm still not entirely convinced that this should be rblcheck's
problem, though; using a local cache like dnscache from
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</ULink> seems like a
much more reliable solution to what is a general misconfiguration.

(from Aaron Schrab <EMail>aaron@schrab.com</EMail>, era eriksson
<EMail>era@iki.fi</EMail>, and torben fjerdingstad
<EMail>tfj@fjerdingstad.dk</EMail>) Add the ability to only list successful
matches, and add a debug mode which outputs what is happening internally,
and any errors received. This could be best implemented with a '-v X'
option, where 'X' is a number between 0 and 9 (0 being silent, 4 being
default/ordinary output, 9 displaying heavy debugging info).
</Para></ListItem>

<ListItem><Para>
Add an option to display the PTR address returned by the original query,
prior to following it.
</Para></ListItem>

<ListItem><Para>
(from Craig Callender <EMail>craig@mosquitonet.com</EMAIL>)
Add the ability to specify a particular PTR address; for example, when
performing a lookup in ORBS, allow for matching against only a specific
returned address (such as 127.0.0.2). Perhaps allow a list of these
matches. The question is: is this better implemented here, or in the
caller via a filter (after the display of PTR addresses is added)?

<Title>...or Not To Do?</Title>

<Para>
These are the features that you'll never see in the version of rblcheck
that I produce (rblcheck is GPL; you're free to produce your own version
if this doesn't suit you well), and the rationale behind why not. I'm
hoping that the explainations will make sense, but I'm always open to
criticism if you feel my logic is flawed.

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Support for doing lookups of FQDNs</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This is a futile method of checking whether a particular system is
blackholed; if the originating system has control of reverse DNS for
their IP space, they can make their IP address resolve to anything
they want, such as system.network.com. If rblcheck were to do a lookup
on that, "system.network.com" might resolve to anything (such as
"127.0.0.1, which will always pass with every currently known
RBL-based blacklist). A compromise that I've considered would be
similar to TCP Wrapper's system of multiple lookups: take the IP
address, look up the reverse, then resolve the reverse to an IP
address. If both lookups match, then proceed, otherwise exit with a
failure. I'd consider integrating code from someone who implemented
this behavior.
</Para>
<Para>
(A note for the confused: some people might mistake this for my saying
that a tool for looking up hosts in DNSBL listings (a means of looking up
originating domains in a blacklist, much like the RBL) isn't a good idea.
On the contrary, I'd like to see a complimentary dnsblcheck to go along
with rblcheck. The problem I have is specifically with resolving the name
to an IP address for use by an RBL lookup tool.)

<Term>Return codes that identify a particular blacklist</Term>

<Para>
This took a while to convince me it was wrong. Here are the questions I went
over when deciding against this:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem><Para>
What do you do with your scripts when the blacklist order changes, or new
blacklists appear (assuming a dynamic assignment of identifiers)?
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
If you hard-code a number for each and every blacklist, who becomes
responsible for being a registry for those numerical identifiers? What
happens to already-assigned values when blacklists shutdown or change
incompatibly?
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
How do you scale beyond 256 RBL services? With the advent of software such as
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/rbldns.html">rbldns</ULink> (a part of the
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</ULink> package which allows
anyone to host an RBL-style service), and with nearly a dozen
<ULink url="http://relays.osirusoft.com/">OsiruSoft</ULink> domains alone,
does this limitation seem reasonable?
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
How do you report multiple matches with a return code, when the return code
can only hold one number?
</Para></ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>
Some of these can be solved, but not cleanly; you'll need no end of special
cases to accomodate them.

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Integrated scanning of email and similar features</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This is a question of UNIX philosophy: design one tool for one task,
and do it well. There are plenty of far more powerful text parsing
tools available which are more appropriate for the job (email parsing
is easily handled by tools such as formail, general text parsing is
better suited by tools such as sed, awk, perl, python, etc), and they
can do a much better job than something that I could integrate into
rblcheck while still maintaining a small footprint.

  <title>GNU General Public License</title>

  <sect1 id="gpl-preamble">
    <title>Preamble</title>
    
    <para>
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit 
      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
      to your programs, too.
    </para>

    <para>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
      programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </para>

    <para>
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
      copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
      must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </para>

    <para>
      We protect your rights with two steps:

      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    copyright the software, and
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
	    distribute and/or modify the software.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If 
      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any 
      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
      reputations.
    </para>

    <para>
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
      licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

      <para>
	This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
	placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
	of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
	program or work, and a <quote>work based on the Program</quote> means either 
	the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
	work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
	modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
	is included without limitation in the term <quote>modification</quote>.) Each

      <para>
	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
	this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not 
	restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
	constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running 
	the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
	of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
	independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, 
	do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when 
	you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the 
	Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
	permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and 
	every part regardless of who wrote it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program

	If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other 
	reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
	agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you 
	from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
	your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
	you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
	royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or 
	indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
	to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property 
	right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
	protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public 
	license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
	distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up 
	to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
	system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    <para>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other written document <quote>free</quote> in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
      commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
      their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This License is a kind of <quote>copyleft</quote>, which means
      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
      free program should come with manuals providing the same
      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited
      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
      printed book. We recommend this License principally for works
      whose purpose is instruction or reference.

      A <quote>Secondary Section</quote> is a named appendix or a

      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical

      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text

    <para>
      If you publish printed copies of the <link
      linkend="fdl-document">Document</link> numbering more than 100,
      and the Document's license notice requires <link
      linkend="fdl-cover-texts">Cover Texts</link>, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all
      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
      <link linkend="fdl-document">Document</link> and satisfy these
      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.

    <para>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit

      adjacent pages.

      you must either include a machine-readable <link

      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material, which the general network-using public has access to
      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
      public.
